## Final Integrated Project - Brand Mashup
![image info](/images/video_one.png)
The objective of this project is to create a new brand by mashing up two brands - Beckâ€™s and Renuzit Snuggle Fabric Refresher together. There will be a series of design and marketing campaigns created to increase brand awareness and achieve a broader aesthetic, attractiveness, and contemporary look while maintaining both original branding.

For this project, I created a 5-page responsive website for the beer brand - Beck's. I am responsible for designing, coding and semantically tagging a static/fixed width, 5 page, HTML5 website.
